# Automated-Trading-Api
An old api project I built in python that is used by a neural network to make investment decisions

# Use
The neural network request data using functions in main.py  
Then it provides an answer whether a stock is predicted to increase or decrease in value  
Then the api either buys or sells a certain amount of the stock  

# Old project
I built this a couple years ago before I knew what OOP was. Also it was built for a very specific purpose, so the code is not the cleanest.
